<a href="maz/cuso_OT.pdf">Slides for CUSO winter school, February 2021</a> (last updated 11/2 9:44pm).  These slides contain animated GIFs that do not show in all PDF readers.  Please use Acrobat Reader (on my Ubuntu 20.04 I use acroread).  Anything other than the GIFs should open normally with any reader.
